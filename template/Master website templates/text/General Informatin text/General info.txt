As Kings Park is a soccer field and has VERY LITTLE natural shade and the first weekend of July is historically VERY hot in the Okanagan, those that plan to spend the day are encouraged to bring some form of sun protection (tent, umbrella, etc.) as well as seating. There will be a limited amount of uncovered bleachers provided for each of the attractions and competitive events.
